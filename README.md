**Priority:** Level Midnight 🚨

## 🏢 The Problem

Sometimes I'll start a sentence, and I don't even know where it's going. I just hope I find it along the way. Corporate sends us memos about "synergy," "paradigm shifts," and "downsizing" (which I thought was a yoga pose).

I asked Oscar to explain it to me, and he used big words. I asked Kevin, and he started talking about cookies.

## 💡 The Solution

**"Explain Like I'm Five"** (Powered by _Computron_)

This is a state-of-the-art, cutting-edge, high-tech... thing. It takes your boring, confusing corporate jargon and translates it into something a five-year-old could understand. Or me. Mostly me.

It uses the **COMPUTRON** (Artificial Intelligence) to break down complex topics into lemonade stands, mommy and daddy giving you a dollar, or why the copier is broken again.

## 🚀 Features (That's What She Said)

- **COMPUTRON:** Uses Groq AI (which is faster than Dwight running to the breakroom for a donut).
- **Michael-Level Simplicity:** Explanations so simple, even a Regional Manager can understand them.
- **Infinite Scroll of Wisdom:** Quotes from the world's best boss (me) scrolling forever.
- **Computron Integration:** It calculates... stuff.
- **Responsive Design:** Works on your computer, Ryan's iPad, and whatever brick phone Creed is using.

## 🛠️ Installation (For the IT Guy... Shadow? Garth?)

If you are not the IT guy, **DO NOT TOUCH THIS**. You will break the internet.

1.  **Clone the Repo** (Not a clone like Dwight's cousin Mose, a code clone):
    \`\`\`bash
    git clone https://github.com/abhay0811/ExplainLike.git
    \`\`\`

2.  **Install Dependencies** (Like gathering the Party Planning Committee):
    \`\`\`bash
    npm install
    \`\`\`

3.  **Set Up Environment** (The Annex):
    Create a \`.env.local\` file. You need a \`GROQ_API_KEY\`. Ask Ryan for it. He's the temp.
    \`\`\`env
    GROQ_API_KEY=your_super_secret_key_that_dwight_cannot_know
    \`\`\`

4.  **Run the App** (Start the Fun Run):
    \`\`\`bash
    npm run dev
    \`\`\`

5.  **Open Browser:** Go to \`http://localhost:3000\`.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer (HR Made Me Add This)

- **Identity theft is not a joke, Jim!** Millions of families suffer every year.
- Don’t commit real API keys. Use `.env.local` for local secrets.
- If the AI starts calling you "Assistant _to the_ Regional Manager," that is a feature, not a bug.
